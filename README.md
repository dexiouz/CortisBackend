REST stands for representational state transfer. 
REST is just a pattern for defining our routes.

To create something we need two routes. First we need the form route that shows us the form and then we need a place for the form to submit. Same thing goes for edit, we need a form where to edit and a place for the form to submit.

REST is just a convention or architecture for mapping our HHTP requests to CRUD functions.
